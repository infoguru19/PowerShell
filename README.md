# Powershell
- PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework developed by Microsoft. 
- It consists of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a framework for processing cmdlets.
## Key aspects of PowerShell include:
### Command-Line Shell:
- Provides an interactive environment for executing commands and scripts.
### Scripting Language:
- A powerful language built on .NET, designed for automating administrative tasks and system management. 
- It supports structured data formats like JSON, CSV, and XML, and interacts well with REST APIs and object models.
### Cmdlets:
- Lightweight commands that perform a single function, often following a Verb-Noun naming convention (e.g., Get-Service, Set-Item).
### Cross-Platform Compatibility:
- While initially developed for Windows, modern PowerShell versions run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
### Object-Oriented Nature:
- Unlike traditional command-line interfaces that primarily deal with text, PowerShell works with objects, allowing for more precise and powerful manipulation of system components.
### Applications:
- Widely used by IT professionals and power users for system administration, configuration management, and automating repetitive tasks in various environments, including local systems, cloud platforms (like Azure), and virtualized environments.
